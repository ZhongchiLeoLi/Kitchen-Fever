Inspired by Overcooked, my team (Alexander Yee, Daniel Tan, Deston Wong, 
Justin Huynh) and I built a kitchen simulator based on similar concepts 
that features:
- Hand-draw graphic and sprites
- Auto-generated randomized orders
- Customization order for user input
- Adjustable cutting and cooking time
